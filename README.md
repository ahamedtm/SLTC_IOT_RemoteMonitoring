**Remote Monitoring of Coke Cans in a Fridge using ESP32 and MQTT Protocol, with Real-time Updates on Smartphones**

This project focuses on the development of a temperature monitoring system for Coke cans in a fridge, providing real-time updates to a smartphone using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. The system utilizes an ESP32 development board, a temperature sensor (such as DS18B20 or dht22), and an ultrasonic or IR sensor. By connecting these components to the ESP32 board, temperature readings are obtained and published on the "esp/temperature" topic every 5 seconds. Additionally, notifications are published on the "esp/notification" topic every 30 minutes, indicating the availability of Coke and the fridge temperature being below a predefined threshold. The MQTT broker, implemented on a Mosquitto Server, serves as the intermediary for communication between the ESP32 and a mobile app installed on a smartphone. Through the mobile app, users can visualize temperature readings in the form of a graph and receive text message notifications regarding the status of Coke bottles in the fridge. This system offers a convenient and efficient way to monitor and manage the temperature of beverages in a fridge remotely.
